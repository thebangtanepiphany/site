      <p>Married couple, Rocky and Emily, love nerding out over BTS. We do song and MV analysis. Excessive fan-girling/fan-boying. <i>Why is there no gender neutral way to say fan-ing?</i></p>
      <p>Sometimes we talk about how BTS <b>infires</b> us to be creative, have a blast, and not give up hope on humanity.</p>
      <p>Othertimes we are just freaking the hell out. <i>Don't get Emily started on the choreo.</i></p>
